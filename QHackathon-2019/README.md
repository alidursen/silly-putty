# Quantum Key Distribution: An Introduction

This work collects and expands "Kuantum Anahtar Dağıtımı: Bir Giriş",
which is the 3rd place project from [Quantum Programming Hackathon](https://www.qturkey.org/hackathon)
held by QTurkey in Ankara, 14-15 December 2019.

Said project, developed by Yusuf Behzat (@yusufbehzat) and Ali Durşen, is a Turkish teaching material
attempting to present a visual demonstration of BB84 quantum key distribution protocol.
This expansion aims to add English language support, as well as formatting improvements.
