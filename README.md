Some problems I face touch my programmer side more than my mathematician side, which shapes the approach to be "Hmm, can't we
use such and such methods to solve this?"

Since we're using Python heavily in our current project at work, this may start as a Python-centric repository but this doesn't
exclude possibility of other languages in the future.
